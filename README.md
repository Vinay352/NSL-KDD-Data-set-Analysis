# NSL-KDD-Data-set-Analysis
A sample analysis of NSL KDD data set is provided in this repository.

First, the data is analysed using Random Forest classifier and Multilayer Perceptron. Later, same learning algorithms are used to analyse the data but after applying various feature selection techniques to the data set.

AIM:-
1) Whether feature selection techniques yield better analysis results as compared to normal analysis results or not
2) Propose possible methods for network intrusion detection
3) Analyse different feature selection techniques

The various feature selection techniques used are:-
1) Feature Importance
2) Recursive Feature Elimination
3) Anova-F Test
